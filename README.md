### Pip installation

Start a terminal (a shell). You'll perform all subsequent steps in this shell.
```bash
# Mac OS X
$ sudo easy_install pip
$ sudo easy_install --upgrade six
```
You can simply install tensorflow on Linux, Mac or Windows with pip install. Note you will need pip version 8.1 or later for the following commands to work on Linux :
```bash
$ pip install tensorflow
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

### Test the TensorFlow installation
#### (Optional, Linux) Enable GPU Support

In order to build or run TensorFlow with GPU support, both NVIDIA's Cuda Toolkit (>= 7.0) and cuDNN (>= v3) need to be installed.

TensorFlow GPU support requires having a GPU card with NVidia Compute Capability (>= 3.0). Supported cards include but are not limited to:

..* NVidia Titan
..* NVidia Titan X
..* NVidia K20
..* NVidia K40
